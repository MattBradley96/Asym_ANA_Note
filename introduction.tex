\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
Precision measurements of heavy quark production at the \lhc form an important part of understanding the landscape of flavour physics.

The forward-central asymmetry is defined as,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Abb}
    \asym \equiv \frac{\Ngreater - \Nless}{\Ngreater + \Nless},
\end{equation}
and was previoulsy measured using 2011 data \cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-023}. This analysis attempts to provide an improved measurement of the asymmetry.

In recent years, results from LHCb in b-physics have shown tensions with the Standard Model (SM). Many models that attempt to explain these anomalies invoke new gauge bosons which would cause an alteration in the value of the asymmetry. By making a precise measurement of the asymmetry, these models may be further constrained. Furthermore, the values of the couplings $Zbb$ and $Zcc$ can be determined by taking a ratio of the measured asymmetries for beauty and charm production. The results for these couplings will be competitive with the previous measurements made at \lep.
